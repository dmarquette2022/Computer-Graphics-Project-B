Project B works in WebGL and moves from 2D space to 3D. Through this project, I was exposed to many concepts pertinent to 3D computer graphics, such as viewports, perspective vs. orthagrphic views, viewing and camera angles, animation using quaternions, and how to navigate a 3D space.

In order to view the working code, simply run the .html file included in each project.
